        "question": "What is the best way to travel to the event?",
        "answer": "For those flying, there are three airports in the area - Dulles (IAD), Baltimore (BWI), and Washington (DCA). Rideshare or Taxi is definitely the most convenient and fastest way to get to College Park. It is possible to take the metro from DCA to College Park but it does require a change from the yellow line to the green line at L'Enfant Plaza and the College Park station is still about a mile from the hotel. The hotel runs a complimentary shuttle that stops at the metro station and River Road, but otherwise rideshares are reliable, fairly cheap, and only take about 5 minutes."
